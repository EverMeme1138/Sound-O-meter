- Remove `[String_Value]` if you doesn't want the string.
- Edit `RMSGain` in `[MeasureAudio]` to change sensitivity
- The skin is a bit CPU intense due to high frame rate, you can lower it by changing `Update` in `[Rainmeter]`\
   Formula: `Update` = (wanted fps)^(-1) x 1000

Known issue:
Some application have much larger or less volume value then others.
